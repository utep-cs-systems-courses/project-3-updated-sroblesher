Salvador Robles Herrera project...

Note that the second button was defectuous since the demo project for the
switches didn't work since when pressing the second button it would stay that
way, meaning that if switch 1 or 2 or 4 was pressed, button 2 would still
diplay that it's being pressed.

At first when there has been no button pressed, the screen displays a mesage
in the screen and it waits for a switch to be pressed to change the screen.

The first button if pressed, consists of dimming a light, starting with a 100%
luminosity and then to a 25% luminosity and then a 12.5% luminosity, this
changing constantly every 4 seconds. The screen displays the luminosity of the
light.

The second button just changes the screen to display "Button 2". This since
the button is defectuous and I didn't want to use that button.

The third button if pressed, displays a cool pattern of spaceships (figure I
created) changing colors and at the same time displaying "Button 3", while
playing a song from Dragon Ball GT.

The fourth button if pressed, displays a spaceship flying up and then
returning down to start again. The screen also displays "Button 4", while
playing a song from Saint Seiya.
